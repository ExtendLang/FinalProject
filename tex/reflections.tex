When working on a long-term project, communication is paramount. Throughout this project, I realized that maximum productivity occurred when the team kept a constant line of communication open regarding language and code design.
Additionally, it's important to identify where people can be most productive. If one person is more efficient at a certain task, more progress will be made if they work on similar material.
Lastly, as the design of the language evolves over time, it's important to build a system that allows for flexibility, as you never know what may change later in the development process.
