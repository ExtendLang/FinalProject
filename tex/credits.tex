\chapter{Special Thanks}
We'd like to thank Bruce Verderaime for the \underline{\href{http://users.fred.net/brv/chart/}{\texttt{gdchart}}} library, which we modified and shipped to provide Extend with graph plotting functionality. Additionally, we'd like to credit Thomas Boutell for the \texttt{gd} library, on which \texttt{gdchart} relies. The copyright notice is in the repository.
